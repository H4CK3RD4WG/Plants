The selection beam allows you to analyse parts of plants. 
There are three Selection Modes: 
-GROWTH FORM		We will encounter plants which 
-LEAF FORM			vary in each of these 
-FLOWER FORM		categories in different ways. 

Movement is possible in selection mode. Additionally you can press
 <b>Q and E</b> on a keyboard or 
 the triggers <b>L1 and R1</b> on a controller to rotate your ship.

By analyzing each of the plants here you will learn about the 
features that characterize their <b>MORPHOLOGY</b>, which helps 
us distinguish how different plants are shaped and grow. 
This is important for the biological work we do.
