The <color=cyan>CYAN</color> selection beam allows you to PICK UP AND MOVE plants by their base. 
You can capture a single plant at a time by clicking its base when the selection beam is <color=red>RED</color>. 
We need this beam to collect specimens of interest in the field when the time comes. 
You will be asked to deliver plants of a certain description to a specific location.
Once you have captured a plant, clicking anywhere will place the plant at that point. 
If it is not in the specified location or the plant does not fit the description given, 
the plant will die immediately. <b>Place the plant in the pylon collection area marked by 
the yellow emblem nearby.</b>
