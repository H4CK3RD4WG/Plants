Try growing the other plants next to you. Each time select each of the three categories on the plant:
-GROWTH FORM
-LEAF FORM
-FLOWER FORM
Once a category is selected for a particular plant, it cannot be 
selected again. Carefully read and understand the descriptions of
parts that you select. You will need this information in the field.
Plants must be fully grown before any selecting can be done, 
so make sure you have water!

Later you will be able to swap selection modes by pressing
 the F key or <color=red>CIRCLE</color> on the gamepad. 
For now, use the proper selection mode as it appears.

You can always press TAB or <color=blue>X</color> to leave the selection beam mode and return to the vehicle's movement controls.
