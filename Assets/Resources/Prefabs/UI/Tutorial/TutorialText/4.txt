The vehicle you occupy has the capacity for flight.
Spin your mouse in very small circles on the mouse-pad, or spin the right joystick. 
Remember, smaller circles are better! 
The lights on your ship will turn red when you are primed for flight. 
Keep spinning your mouse until all the lights are green.
You must keep spinning to stay in the air.
<b>Once you are in the air, fly up to the pylons on the hill surrounded by water.</b> 
Use <b>Q and E</b> on a keyboard or the triggers <b>L1 and R1</b> on a controller to rotate in the air.
