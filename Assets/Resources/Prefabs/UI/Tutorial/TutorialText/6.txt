Look at the water tank on the side of your vehicle.
You've depleted all of your water.
Your research vehicle cannot fly without stored water, 
and we cannot complete our objective without water. 
<b>Find a water source</b> and spin as you would to fly 
after positioning your vehicle on the surface of the water. 
Make sure to fill up completely.
