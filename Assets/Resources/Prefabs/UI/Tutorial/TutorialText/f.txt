-A biological reference manual is contained in the top, <color=magenta>MAGENTA</color> button, 
allowing access to all of the information you just received from selecting plant samples.
Open it by clicking or pressing <color=magenta>SQUARE</color> on a controller when the menu is open.
-A utilities page is in the rightmost, <color=red>RED</color> button, where you can go to the main menu, quit the game,
or teleport to the City where our work will take place. 
Open this menu by clicking or pressing <color=red>CIRCLE</color> on a controller when the menu is open.
<b>When you are ready to start playing, select this button and swap scenes.</b>
