Each category is analyzed according to its own selection beam. 
GROWTH FORM has a <color=magenta>MAGENTA</color> selection beam. 
You can always tell which selection mode you are in by the icon in 
the upper left corner. The tree icon indicates you are selecting 
GROWTH FORM. The selection beam will turn 
<color=red>RED</color> when you can click a plant for analysis.
GROWTH FORM describes how the plant is organized, 
usually in terms of how the branches and leaves relate to the 
general structure of the plant. 
<b>Always click on the base node where the plant grew from when 
you want to analyze GROWTH FORM.</b> If you are using a controller, 
try pressing <color=magenta>SQUARE</color> when the selection beam is <color=red>RED</color>.

The most important part of the plant identification we are doing here are <color=green>NODES</color>.
Nodes are imaginary objects that botanists say mark the spot where 
a branch comes out of another branch. Usually branches between 
nodes are called <color=green>INTERNODES</color>. Nodes are also 
the places where leaves and flowers emerge from branches. 
<b>Find a <color=green>NODE</color> on the plant before you.</b>
Remember, <color=green>NODES</color> can only be selected when your
ship has a <color=magenta>MAGENTA</color> selection beam.
