Compound leaves divide their surface into many
individual leaflets. These leaflets are not leaves
unto themselves-this is an important point, and
requires remembering that leaves only emerge from
nodes on branches. Instead, leaflets are substructures 
of compound leaves and distinguish them from other leaves.
