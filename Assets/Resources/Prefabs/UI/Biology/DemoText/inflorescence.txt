Inflorescences are a kind of flower
structure which have multiple flowers
branched or patterned along them. The
entire inflorescent structure (not 
the individual flowers) emerges from
nodes along the branches. This is
nearly exactly how compound leaves
are structured, replacing leaflets
with flowers.
Check the description of a compound 
leaf if this analogy is unclear.
Understanding the location of the nodes on
the plant is essential when you are trying to
decide if a structure is an inflorescence
