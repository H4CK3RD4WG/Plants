Palmate leaves are half-way between simple
and compound leaves. These leaves have lobes
or veins which may be attached to one another 
in part, but always diverge in some way. Most
importantly, they all diverge from a common 
point. Palmate leaves are often compared to
the way your fingers emerge from your hand.
