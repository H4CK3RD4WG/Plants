Flowers can be classified by drawing
imaginary lines across their faces.
Flowers are zygomorphic when they
have only one line of symmetry. That
is, we can divide them only one way
to create two equal halves; the results 
are mirror images of each other. Think
of the way a five-pointed star looks,
and in which ways you can cut it to
create symmetrical halves.
