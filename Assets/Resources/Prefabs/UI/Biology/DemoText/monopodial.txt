Monopodial branching structures have a central branch called a main axis.
All other branches emerging from nodes can be traced back to this branch.
Monopodial means 'one-footed'-the central branch is usually this most
vertical single 'foot' of the tree. It is where the stem meets the ground
and transitions into the root system of the plant.
